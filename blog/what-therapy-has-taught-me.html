    <h1>What therapy has taught me</h1>
    <p class="">October 17, 2025</p>
    <article class="mt-4">
      <p>Hello my friend,</p><p>I have been a hypocrite.</p><p>I posted a couple of days ago on LinkedIn about doing therapy.</p><p>The truth is that I put off sharing it for some time.</p><p>Worried about exactly how it would be perceived or how the reaction may be.</p><p>It was something personal, for me, and it wasn’t my "normal” type of post.</p><p>I then realised I was being a hypocrite to the very thing I’m trying to encourage.</p><p>A stigma I’m trying to break.</p><p><br/>Since the start of this year I’ve had regular therapy sessions.</p><p>Quite frankly they have been one of the best investments I’ve ever made.<br/><br/>But, wait, what’s wrong Nick?<br/><br/>This is a common question many have and it ties in to why I didn’t write or post about it before. <br/><br/>The honest answer to this question is…<br/><br/>Absolutely nothing was wrong.<br/><br/>Quite the contrary actually.</p><p>I was feeling strong and well.</p><p>That I had all my shit together. </p><p>Or so it seemed to me…<br/><br/>Why I started was down to pure curiosity to learn more about myself.<br/><br/>I started it from a place of strength, not weakness.<br/><br/>This is where many people still have it backwards.<br/><br/>I started out of wanting to understand and learn about me more.<br/><br/>I wanted to look at my mind and get a better understanding of how it works.<br/><br/>Then as the sessions went on I started digging into things from my past.<br/><br/>Areas of my life that I’d actually been ignoring or refusing to knowledge.<br/><br/>Many that I had no idea 100% affect who I am, and how I am today.</p><p>That get in my way and continue to hurt me.</p><p>What I’ve learned is this.<br/><br/>We all know we should exercise so we won’t have health problems in the future.<br/><br/>We all know we should see a physio to overcome or prevent injuries down the line.<br/><br/>We all know we should eat well so we are not forced to later.<br/><br/>Yet when it comes to strengthening our mind we see it differently.</p><p>Therapy does just that.<br/><br/>But I also kind of get the stigma and resistance.</p><p><br/>My mum recently contacted the NHS in the UK to enquire about therapy.<br/><br/>The first question she was asked?<br/><br/>Ok, and what’s the problem exactly?<br/><br/>This isn’t right.</p><p>There shouldn’t need to be “a problem” to start.</p><p>This is why we have the stigma and a lack of vulnerability in the very first place.</p><p>What even is a problem anyway? How do we define one exactly?</p><p>Is there a list of acceptable ones?</p><p>Come on, lets do better.<br/><br/>Personally my only regret is that I didn’t start therapy sooner.<br/><br/>It’s my other gym. One for my mind.</p><p>Therapy has taught me and given me plenty.<br/><br/>I’ve uncovered and discovered things I would never have known, and without the guidance of a therapist would never have had the courage to admit and to work on.<br/><br/>So if you are struggling with something or are having a hard time I would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>However, and which is the case for many, if things seem fine and like you’ve got everything under control I would also absolutely recommend it.<br/><br/>Like I myself thought before, if you don’t think you need it then you may need it a lot more than you think.</p><p>It’s time we finally put an end to demonising or avoiding doing some therapy.</p><p>To put to bed that it means something is wrong or that something is wrong with us.</p><p>This is completely false.</p><p>It is a tool to strengthen us, not to fix something that is broken.</p><p>I stand for openly having the conversation around therapy like we talk about anything else.</p><p>As a man, I see this is especially rare.</p><p>Showing vulnerability is a true sign of strength and character. </p><p>I once didn't fully believe this. </p><p>I now believe it with every part of me.</p><p>Therapy at worst will present you with a ton of information and insights you weren’t aware of.</p><p>Therapy at best will unlock a completely different version of yourself.</p><p>Either way you’ll only gain.</p><p>And so will all those around you.</p><p>The more you think you don’t need it the more you likely do.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p><p>With love, Nick x</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/what-therapy-has-taught-me?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/what-therapy-has-taught-me/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="directMessage button"></div><p></p>
