In other words, make things as easy as possible for yourself. </p><p>That’s the good life, right?</p><p>We have become so sold on this we even believe it to be true.</p><p>It’s not.</p><p>Having a life of comfort, avoiding change and challenge is dangerous and damaging.</p><p>It restricts not only all our growth and development, but nulls our desire to even want to in the first place.</p><p>Because the need to evolve and adapt has all but been stripped away in this world we currently live in.</p><p>No fight required, no change necessary. </p><p>But there is no such thing as a free lunch, they say.</p><p>It has resulted in obesity, addiction, disease, suicide, like never seen before.</p><p>Anxiety and depression rates sky high.</p><p>Cries of a lack of purpose echoing from every corner.</p><p>All forming an epidemic of the very worst kind.</p><p>On a scale that a Covid-19 could never touch.</p><p>We must pay attention to our society of comfort and what it wants from us.</p><p>A place where boredom is seen as a problem and something to be avoided at all costs.</p><p>Because it feels an inconvenience, unnecessary, even painful.</p><p>It wasn’t before, boredom was perfectly fine. After all it’s where the brain does it’s best thinking and is most creative.</p><p>But not now. </p><p>It feels hard and annoying, so we distract ourselves immediately.</p><p>We are dumbing down our brains, and the saddest part is we don’t realise it.</p><p>Centuries before, people were forced to do hard things, be uncomfortable and live in uncertainty. </p><p>Being in the unknown, learning constantly, being bored, protecting their communities, taking risks, pushing themselves physically.</p><p>Thriving in the daily challenges.</p><p>They were forced to learn, to adapt, to grow, yet these were the very things that brought out the best in them.</p><p>Disease, depression, despair all non existent.</p><p>People were content and well.</p><p>We are fortunate that for most of us we don’t have to live in complete uncertainty on a daily basis.</p><p>That we have most things taken care of and everything that we need available.</p><p>But we mustn’t fall back and depend on this.</p><p>We must break free from comfort and ease which is promoted all around us.</p><p>So many people are now facing the above conditions.</p><p>They aren’t forced or even encouraged to do harder things. </p><p>To strive further out of their comfort zone. To become more comfortable being uncomfortable.</p><p>These are at the heart of the epidemic.</p><p>Don’t be deluded, manipulated or deceived into thinking we or life should be remain comfortable.</p><p>That boredom and uncertainty should not be embraced.</p><p>That technology should do all the work for us.</p><p>That we should pay someone else to get things we don’t like done.</p><p>That our phone and social media are making us smarter.</p><p>That we should have our food delivered rather than picking it up - dare I say make it ourselves!</p><p>Add yours to the list.</p><p>These are lies.</p><p>Lies that make a lot of money.</p><p>If we want to live well and achieve in our life we cannot conform to what our current society and its marketing desire for us.</p><p>Learn something from our ancestors. </p><p>Get a little uncomfortable again.</p><p>Do hard things again.</p><p>Do it yourself and for yourself. </p><p>If something seems too easy, it most likely is. </p><p>Just like if something seems too good to be true, it most likely is. </p><p>Break free from the comfort crisis.</p><p>Just because everyone around us is doing something doesn’t mean we should follow suit.</p><p>Otherwise the coincidences will follow.</p><p>Our health, our success, our meaning will suffer gravely. </p><p>These can only be grown if we ourselves are growing, and we cannot grow if we remain comfortable.</p><p>If something in life feels uncertain, challenging or hard it’s no cause for concern.</p><p>It likely shows you’re on the right path.</p><p></p><h3>Things I’m learning</h3><p><strong>The Affect Heuristic.</strong></p><p>The affect heuristic influences our decisions by causing us to focus on how we <em>feel </em>rather than carefully what we <em>know. </em>We rely on emotions rather than concrete information. This can have various consequences, shaping not only our daily decisions but also skewing how we evaluate the risks and benefits of a given choice in moments of uncertainty. </p><p><strong>Values over moods.</strong></p><p>“A mark of emotional intelligence is prioritising your values over your mood. Immature people are victims of their feelings. Their choices are governed by fleeting sensations. </p><p>Mature people take responsibility for their reactions. Their choices are guided by lasting principles.” - <em>Adam Grant</em></p><p><strong>Staying out the fight.</strong></p><p>“I’m at the stage of my life where I stay out of arguments. Even if you say 1 + 1 = 5, you’re right. Have fun.” - <em>Keanu Reeves</em></p><h3>Question</h3><p>Who are you trying to impress that doesn’t matter? Who are the people who deserve you trying to impress?</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p><p>Until next time.</p><p>Nick. x</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/the-comfort-crisis-and-why-we-must?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/the-comfort-crisis-and-why-we-must/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="directMessage button"></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
