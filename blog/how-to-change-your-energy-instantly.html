    <h1>How To Change Your Energy Instantly</h1>
    <p class="">January 30, 2026</p>
    <article class="mt-4">
      <p>Hello my friend,</p><p>Energy is our superpower. </p><p>It is infinite.</p><p>It has no limits.</p><p>It’s our greatest asset as human beings.</p><p>But there is something we still misunderstand about it.</p><p>We think of energy as something we<em> have</em> or we don’t <em>have.</em> </p><p>But here is the truth.</p><p>Energy is not just something we <em>have</em>, it’s something we <em>do</em>.</p><p>Imagine yourself in this situation for a minute.</p><p>You’ve had an exceptionally busy day at work. </p><p>You faced problem after problem, constant stressful moments and had no time to stop. </p><p>Several hours later you finally get home. </p><p>You see the comfy sofa, you head straight for it to lie down.</p><p>No time to eat, barely time to breathe all day. </p><p>You feel completely zapped.</p><p>All you want to do is turn off the world, do nothing, and speak with no one. </p><p>You tell yourself you <em>have </em>no energy left. </p><p>Then your phone rings. </p><p>It’s your best friend on the other line. </p><p>You think for a second about answering as you’re so exhausted. </p><p>You know she would understand.</p><p>But you decide to pick up.</p><p>Just as you’re about to ask her if you can chat another time, she drops a news bomb. </p><p>She cannot contain her excitement as she tells you she just got engaged! </p><p>Her emotions are high and she expresses how deeply happy she is.</p><p>What happens next?</p><p>Do you still feel the same?</p><p>Do you still have no energy? </p><p>Do you still want to chat another time?</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>Your energy explodes.</p><p>It’s suddenly sky high and you are now more present than you’ve been all day. </p><p>(If you are actually happy on hearing this news of course!)</p><p>So what happened?</p><p>Your energy changed instantly.</p><p>There was a stimulus that created immense energy in your body.</p><p>Five seconds ago you felt exhausted with zero energy after that tough day.</p><p>Now you feel like you could talk for hours.</p><p>Think about that example for a moment. </p><p>Now think back to a similar moment you’ve experienced where something completely shifted your energy in a flash.</p><p>What I’m getting at here is our energy can change instantly.</p><p>It can take an external stimuli but also an internal one. </p><p>Energy can be accessed at any moment.</p><p>When it comes to public speaking or connecting with other people our energy is by far the most important aspect.</p><p>Perhaps the only important one.</p><p>Without energy we cannot connect, never mind impact or inspire others.</p><p>We can have the best and most life changing story to share but if we have no energy it won’t land.</p><p>Energy isn’t about jumping or running around like crazy. </p><p>It is not shouting loudly or being the centre of attention.</p><p>It is not rushing around or moving aimlessly.</p><p>It is presence.</p><p>Is is being fully in the moment.</p><p>Not just how we talk but how we listen.</p><p>Not just how we move but how we stand.</p><p>It is becoming truly present with yourself and with others.</p><p>It is always available even when it feels unavailable. </p><p>Because it is an action. We <em>do</em> energy.</p><p>How many times have you dreaded doing a workout yet as soon as you start you feel completely different?</p><p>You thought you had no energy and now suddenly you are completely energized.</p><p>When connecting with our people and our audience we have to show up with intention.</p><p>We have to be present with ourselves and with them.</p><p>That is how we truly connect.</p><p>We must choose how we want to show up.</p><p>Our energy is contagious.</p><p>Other people and our audience feed off it.</p><p>All the other tools and aspects of public speaking, communicating or anything else for that matter, come later.</p><p>But they aren’t relevant if we don’t create our energy first.</p><p>Focus on the energy you want to show up with.</p><p>Because that will make or break any impression or connection.</p><p>Do it.</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/how-to-change-your-energy-instantly?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p></p><p>Thank you for reading,</p><p>With Love, Nick x</p><p></p><p>PS: Thank you to everyone who came to “An Evening With Running Minds” last week in Madrid for Malin Garemo’s talk “The Thinking Athlete”. </p><p>It was a fantastic evening jam-packed with practical insights around the gut, brain, body, resilience, performance and much more!</p><p>Watch this space for more events coming soon.</p><p>If you have a background, experience or personal story related to health, well-being, business or performance and would be interested in sharing with our community at Running Minds, pelase reach out to me. </p><p>A photo from the event with Malin and myself.
