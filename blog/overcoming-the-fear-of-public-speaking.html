No-one expects perfect, or even wants it.<br/><br/>So don’t set your bar unrealistically high. Aim for progress, over perfection.</p><p><strong>Tip two: Low exposure</strong><br/><br/>Like training for a marathon we can’t just go from the sofa to running a 26.2 miles. That will injure us.<br/><br/>We start small, and build up the miles little by little each week.<br/><br/>We then make some small adjustments until over some time we become physically ready for the event.<br/><br/>The same applies in public speaking. You can’t go from zero to hero right away.<br/><br/>This would paralyse anyone with fear and uncertainty.<br/><br/>The trick is a little exposure at a time.<br/><br/>This will show you that your worst predictions won’t come true.<br/><br/>It then expands your tolerance until the event isn’t such a big deal.<br/><br/>Practice speaking in all situations.<br/><br/>At home or in the office with family, friends, colleagues.<br/><br/>Start with one person. Build up your confidence and ability.<br/><br/>Be patient and expose yourself gently.</p><p><strong>Tip three: Pay attention to physiology</strong></p><p>The mind and body connection is real - and the good news when speaking in public is that you can influence the way you feel.<br/><br/>There was a famous study where people put a pencil between their teeth to smile. </p><p>It turns out that holding a pencil between the teeth contracts the same muscles that are used for a genuine smile. <br/><br/>The study compared those “faking a smile” versus those who weren’t smiling at all.<br/><br/>The result?<br/><br/>Those who mimicked a genuine smile felt less stressed and more positive than the others.<br/><br/>So what does this teach us?<br/><br/>It teaches us that what we do with our expressions and body language makes a significant difference to how we feel.<br/><br/>Before you next do any public speaking do a body check first.<br/><br/>Become aware of your posture, facial expression, breathing and where your hands are.<br/><br/>You can impact how you feel through changing your physiology which then will create the psychology you want before speaking.<br/><br/>If the body is strong and prepared the mind will follow.</p><p><strong>Tip four: Practice</strong><br/><br/>“You don’t rise to expectations, you fall to the level of your preparation.”<br/><br/>The same goes for public speaking. <br/><br/>For all the wonderful tactics and tools you’re learning, you have to put them to practice. Over and over again.<br/><br/>It’s by far the best way to improve. Perhaps the only way, really.<br/><br/>Practicing as much as you possibly can.<br/><br/>This will require some added courage to put yourself out there more.<br/><br/>It is important to also remember all practice isn’t made equal. There is a difference between the bathroom mirror and in front of real people.<br/><br/>Seek opportunities to practice - with others.<br/><br/>Find a group to practice (Toastmasters is perfect for example) or practice in front of a group of friends or colleagues before your all important pitch or presentation.<br/><br/>Find the opportunities to practice and remember mistakes are the gateway to improvement.<br/><br/>This will not only enhance your ability speaking in public, but your confidence too, whilst making your nerves feel more manageable.<br/><br/>It sends a clear message to the brain that you’re practiced and prepared.</p><p><strong>Tip five: Service</strong><br/><br/>Ultimately public speaking is all about serving your audience.<br/><br/>Whoever they may be, you are there to offer them value.<br/><br/>They aren’t looking for perfection and they don’t care about how well you “perform”.<br/><br/>They only care about your message and the value you can offer them through it.<br/><br/>Nothing else.<br/><br/>In fact, if you do make a few errors or mess up a bit it will make you even more relatable.<br/><br/>On top of that if you own those errors you’ll come across even more authentic and real.<br/><br/>That only builds connection further.<br/><br/>At the end of the day your audience are human beings just like you with exactly the same fears and doubts.<br/><br/>Something important to keep in mind that you are not speaking IN public, you are speaking WITH the public.<br/><br/>You are sharing value and service with them.<br/><br/>So in summary, yes work on the skills to develop your level when public speaking but remember you’re already standing on a mountain of value ready to share right now.<br/><br/>The only thing your audience cares about is receiving it.</p><p>Good luck out there!</p><p><em><strong>Working with me</strong></em></p><p><em>If you are looking to grow your confidence and develop your speaking skills you can learn more and get in touch with me <a href="https://nickhampshire.com/">here</a></em></p><h3>Things I’m learning</h3><p>​<strong>Being world-class comes with some extreme worldviews.</strong></p><p>“More than half of aspiring athletes would be willing to take a drug that would kill them in 5 years in exchange for winning every competition.</p><p>14% of elite performers would accept a fatal cardiovascular condition in exchange for an Olympic gold medal.” - <em>Rob Henderson</em> (via <span class="mention-wrap"></span> )</p><p><strong>Distrusting loud public claims.</strong></p><p>“Many of the most chaotic and emotionally lawless people you’ve ever known are posting on a regular basis about having at long last achieved inner peace.” -<em> Elizabeth Gilbert</em></p><p><strong>Living a life with no regrets.</strong></p><p>“You can fail at what you don’t want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love?” - <em>Jim Carrey</em></p><h3>Question</h3><p>If no-one was watching what would you be doing differently?</p><p>If everyone was watching what would you be doing differently?</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p><p>With Love, Nick x</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/overcoming-the-fear-of-public-speaking?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/overcoming-the-fear-of-public-speaking/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="directMessage button"></div><p></p>
