Placing more attention on looking after the most important organ.</p><p>Our mind can only help us if we are helping our brain.</p><p><br/>Regular exercise, a balanced and unprocessed diet, quality sleep, removing alcohol, removing toxins, drinking enough water, being in nature.</p><p>These are some of the most important foundations for a healthy brain.</p><p>The good news is all of these are within our control, at least to some degree.</p><p>We can give our brain more of the care and attention it needs.</p><p>In return our mind will thank us.</p><h3><br/><br/>Things I’m learning</h3><p><strong>Exposure impact.</strong></p><p>A study on the Boston Marathon bombings found that prolonged exposure to media coverage of the event, specifically six or more daily hours of media exposure in the week following the bombings, was associated with higher levels of acute stress than direct exposure to the event itself. This research, led by Roxane Cohen Silver, indicates that frequent engagement with trauma-related media can significantly impact psychological distress, even for those who were not physically present at the bombing.</p><p><strong>Nothing to lose.</strong></p><p>“if you’re procrastinating on something because you’re worried you won’t do a good enough job, you can relax - because judged by the flawless standards of your imagination, you definitely won’t do a good enough job. So you might as well make a start.” - Oliver Burkeman.</p><p><strong>Get away from the crowd.</strong></p><p>"One way to stand out is to look for pockets of low competition.</p><p>Wake up early—less traffic, fewer people.</p><p>Go deeper or narrower in your field—less noise, more space.</p><p>People are drawn to where it is crowded. Look for the quiet spaces inside your areas of interest. Excellence often hides at the edges." - James Clear</p><h3>Question</h3><p>If someone was watching the movie of your life right now what would they be screaming at the screen for you to do?</p><p>That’s all for this week.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p>With love, Nick x</p><p>p.s. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nickhampshire1_the-problem-with-confidence-we-are-told-activity-7340684481667739648-pNaC?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABZD7ewBWsGrJOHGIG5jGmPuCErx8j1H2_o">The problem with confidence</a></p><div class="captioned-button-wrap"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading The Process!
