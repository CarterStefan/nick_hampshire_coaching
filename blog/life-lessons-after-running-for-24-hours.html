    <h1>Life lessons after running for 24 hours</h1>
    <p class="">October 24, 2025</p>
    <article class="mt-4">
      <p>Last weekend I took a journey around a 400 meter track for 24 hours.</p><p>It was quite possibly the hardest physical and mental challenge I have taken on to date.</p><p>The hours of solitude and no sleep on top of an aching body and a mind constantly telling me to quit.</p><p>Well, fortunately I didn’t listen.</p><p>I kept moving and I finally hit the 24 hour mark.</p><p>It was gruelling but I expected no less.</p><p>I realised there was only one way to get through and complete it.</p><p>I had focus on the process over the result.</p><p>I knew there was no chance I could continue across the full 24 hours if I focused on that figure.</p><p>If my mind was only on the finish line.</p><p>The only way was to break it down into small chunks.</p><p>An hour at a time, to a kilometre at a time, to a lap at a time.</p><p>Until things got really tough when it became literally one step at a time.</p><p>Over the time all those steps started to stack up.</p><p>141 kilometres worth.</p><p>The result took care of itself. </p><p>It was better than I could have imagined.</p><p>But all I concentrated on was just managing each part of the process the best I could.</p><p>I didn’t look too far ahead. </p><p>That was essential to give myself the best chance of completing the time.</p><p>Life is just like this.</p><p>Growing a business.</p><p>Building a relationship.</p><p>Getting in better shape. </p><p>Investing or saving money.</p><p>You name it.</p><p>Anything worthwhile and sustainable is built in small chunks over time.</p><p>It’s not sexy and it doesn’t sell but it’s the only way.</p><p>Unless you get lucky.</p><p>But that’s exactly what it is - luck. And luck is not a skill we can develop.</p><p>A problem seems too challenging if we are only looking at the whole thing.</p><p>A challenge seems too hard if we are only looking at the finish line.</p><p>A dream seems too big if we are only looking at the destination. </p><p>Whatever you’re working towards, break it down.</p><p>Whatever problem you’re facing take the first step towards a solution.</p><p>Then take another.</p><p>Face one at a time.</p><p>Focus on only what you have control over.</p><p>We cannot control an outcome but we can control our next step.</p><p>Whatever goal you’re working towards, this same rule applies.</p><p>Create smaller more manageable steps. </p><p>The real issues arise when we try to solve or complete the whole thing at once or we look too far down the road.</p><p>When we skip the steps and jump straight into wanting the result. </p><p>Or when we sprint instead of managing our pace.</p><p>This will nearly always fail. Or if it doesn’t now, it will later.</p><p>It only causes stress, anxiety and ultimately, burnout.</p><p>It’s incredible what we can learn, what we can build, what we can succeed at if we break it down and play a longer term game.</p><p>If we control the controllable.</p><p>In life there is no finish line, so what’s the rush?</p><p>However audacious the goal is and whatever area it’s in it can only ever built by focusing on one task, one move, one step at a time.</p><p>As Will Smith said, “I’m going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid. You do that every single day and soon you have a wall.”</p><p>One at a time. </p><p>Manage your pace.</p><p>Manage this next moment.</p><p>Where can you lay the next brick?</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p><p>With love, Nick </p><p></p><p><em>For speaking, hosting or coaching enquires please go here: </em><a href="http://www.nickhampshire.com">visit my website</a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/what-running-for-24-hours-taught?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/what-running-for-24-hours-taught/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="directMessage button"></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
