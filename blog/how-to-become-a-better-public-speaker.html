    <h1>How to Become a Better Public Speaker</h1>
    <p class="">February 20, 2026</p>
    <article class="mt-4">
      <p>Hello my friend,</p><p>We often seek out the tricks and tips when it comes to improving any skill.</p><p>The same is true for speaking in public.</p><p>Many will look for the “hacks” to become better on stage or whilst communicating.</p><p>But these are not the right thing to look for.</p><p>At least not to start with.</p><p>There are of course plenty of so-called hacks, alongside tricks and tips to speak better in public. Many of which are important and certainly have their place.</p><p>But I’m far more interested in the preparation and improvement that really makes the difference, over the long term.</p><p>The most important performance enhancer that no-one talks about.</p><p>How we take care of ourselves.</p><p>I spent almost two decades coaching health and fitness.</p><p>I worked with executives where consistent high performance in their work was crucial.</p><p>None of them quit our training when they saw the staggering impact it had on their performance levels in the office.</p><p>Quality health is vital when it comes to our performance.</p><p>That might sound obvious, right?</p><p>But we don’t think about our health and fitness levels in respect to communication or public speaking. </p><p>Something we will all have to do at one stage or another (pun intended)!</p><p>They are also absolutely aligned.</p><p>I have been fortunate enough to have now worked with several leading CEO’s and founders.</p><p>All of them have to speak in public regularly.</p><p>All of them want to improve it.</p><p>They often ask me “how can I use my body and voice better on stage?”</p><p>“How can I improve my stage presence and or my delivery?”</p><p>Ultimately how they can impact and influence others better.</p><p>All valid questions.</p><p>But some often miss the bigger picture.</p><p>The most important factors.</p><p>The critical performance factors that really matter.</p><p>Those that lead to better performance and deeper connection when speaking.</p><p>Energy, presence, focus and control.</p><p>These are what really count, and they cannot be built through hacks.</p><p>They are created through building a foundation of a sound body and mind.</p><p>These are built through taking care of ourselves every day.</p><p>Prioritising our health.</p><p>Over years and decades.</p><p>This is the best preparation and performance enhancer.</p><p>Quality sleep. Regular exercise. Hydration. Balanced nutrition.</p><p>These four key factors move the needle far more than anything else when it comes to our performance levels over the long term.</p><p>They have the most direct influence.</p><p>Building our confidence and increasing our presence. </p><p>Managing our anxiety and controlling our stress response.</p><p>All critical in any high performing situation.</p><p>Health is the bedrock.</p><p>The table everything else sits on.</p><p>The foundation to perform better as a public speaker, communicator and furthermore, in any part of life.</p><p>All the hacks, tricks and tips are built on top.</p><p>If you want to improve your ability and performance look first at how you’re looking after your health.</p><p></p><p><em>If you want like to discuss your own performance and how I could help you, you can <a href="https://calendly.com/nickhampshire1/chat">book a call</a> with me here.</em></p><p><em>Or visit my <a href="http://www.nickhampshire.com">website</a> for my information on my work.</em></p><p>Thank you for reading.</p><p>Nick x</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/how-to-become-a-better-public-speaker?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/how-to-become-a-better-public-speaker/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="directMessage button"></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
