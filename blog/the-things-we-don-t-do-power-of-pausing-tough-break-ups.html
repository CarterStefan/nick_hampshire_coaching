It’s give us a shot of dopamine. It sells. </p><p>We associate happiness or fulfillment, peace or success with the things that we do in our lives.</p><p>But I’m more interested in the things we don’t do.</p><p>Those are the things which bring us closer to everything we’re seeking.</p><p>What we choose not to engage in. </p><p>Who we choose not to spend time with.</p><p>Where we say no.</p><p>The habits, behaviours and decisions we opt-out of.</p><p>These are what we should be paying most attention to.</p><blockquote><p>“Success is largely the failures you avoid.” - James Clear</p></blockquote><p>Maybe they are harder to acknowledge and appreciate because they aren’t as glamorous or sexy.</p><p>Not particularly exciting, inspiring or serotonin rushing. </p><p>Boring, perhaps.</p><p>No-one will pat us on the back for them.</p><p>They won’t be instagram worthy. </p><p>But they are what pay the huge dividends.</p><p>Not over-consuming.</p><p>Not taking harmful substances.</p><p>Not spending time with toxic people.</p><p>Not being around negativity.</p><p>Not getting injured.</p><p>Not engaging in arguments.</p><p>Not over-working.</p><p>Not retaliating.</p><p>Not being distracted.</p><p>Not checking the phone every 10 minutes. </p><p>Not making hasty purchases.</p><p>Not saying yes when you really want to say no.</p><p>The decisions we don’t make provide massive rewards which are often overlooked.</p><p>They may not be as exciting but they are what move the needle.</p><p>Over the long term it will be the certain habits, behaviours and decisions that we avoid that will serve us most.</p><p>They are what will bring us everything we think we must <strong>do</strong> in order to receive them.</p><p>We have it backwards.</p><p>The things we want the most are a question of the things that we don’t do.</p><p></p><p><em>Working with me</em></p><p><em>I help businesses with their communication and public speaking through training, executive coaching and speaking.

A systematic review and meta-analysis published in PLOS ONE examined the efficacy of micro-breaks - short pauses of no longer than 10 minutes - on well-being and performance. The findings revealed that micro-breaks significantly boost vigor and reduce fatigue. Moreover, longer breaks were associated with greater performance improvements, particularly in tasks requiring creativity and clerical work. </p><p><strong>You know better.</strong></p><p>“If you’re so smart why aren’t you happy?”- Naval</p><p><strong>Being in a toxic relationship with our phone.</strong></p><p>“When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail: the more I used my phone to navigate my life, the less capable I felt of navigating life without my phone.” - Catherine Price</p><h3>Question</h3><p>If mistakes are the path for improvement, why aren’t you making more?</p><h3>Life hack</h3><p>Drink a large glass of water before your morning coffee. Caffeine spikes cortisol which increases stress and sometimes feelings of anxiety. Wait an hour or at least fully hydrate first.</p><p>Caveat: Taking caffeine straight before a workout can provide benefits to training. </p><p>That’s all for this week. Thanks as ever for reading. </p><p>All I ask is you like this newsletter please share it with a friend. It really keeps me going!</p><p>With Love, Nick. x</p><p>p.s. Go and watch the film ‘Her’. Released over a decade ago. Mind-blowing. </p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/the-things-we-dont-do-power-of-pausing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/the-things-we-dont-do-power-of-pausing/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="directMessage button"></div><p></p>
