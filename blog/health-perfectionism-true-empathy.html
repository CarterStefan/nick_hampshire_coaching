Until there isn’t. </p><p>Saying we don’t have time is an excuse.</p><p>It’s just not a priority.</p><p>I know because I have plenty of experience saying “I don’t have the time” for various things in my life.</p><p>I was lying to myself.</p><p>They simply weren’t important enough to me to make the time.</p><p>Or they felt a little too uncomfortable that I preferred not to.</p><p>Mañana. </p><p>Imagine there was a free pill you could take which increased longevity and heart health more than anything else? Exercise.</p><p>Imagine there was a free pill that decreased stress, increased energy and boosted the immune system more than anything else? Sleep.</p><p>These two alone are fundamental to quality health yet sometimes we don’t give them the respect and attention they deserve.</p><p>In Daniel Pink’s book ‘The Power of Regret’ he found that one of the biggest regrets of the older generation was they wish they had paid more attention to their health.</p><p>Many stuck at home with limited mobility and various conditions, they could see clearly with hindsight the investment they wish they’d made earlier.</p><p>All the money in the bank and the time in the world became irrelevant. </p><p>Our health is our number one resource and asset. </p><p>The more we invest in our health the better everything gets.</p><p>It’s not just the best thing we can do for ourselves but for everyone else around us.</p><p>We show up on a different level when we feel good.</p><p>The job or career doesn’t matter if we don’t have our health.</p><p>Our relationships, family and social life can barely function without it.</p><p>Without the table there is nowhere to build or to sit.</p><p>Nothing else matters without it.</p><p>As Confucius said, a healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one.</p><h3>Things I’m learning</h3><p><strong>Perfectionist problems.</strong></p><p>Perfectionism is divided into three categories. Self-oriented perfectionism implies the tendency to expect perfection of oneself. Other-oriented perfectionism implies the tendency to be demanding of others. And socially-prescribed perfectionism implies the belief that others expect you to be perfect. So, preoccupied with approval, the perfectionist often becomes a people-pleaser, obsessed with the purity of some specific role, despite lacking a preference to embody it for its own sake.</p><p><strong>If you cannot decide, the answer is no. </strong></p><p>“And the reason is, modern society is full of options. There are tons and tons of options. We live on a planet of seven billion people, and we are connected to everybody on the internet. There are hundreds of thousands of careers available to you. There are so many choices.</p><p>You’re biologically not built to realize how many choices there are. Historically, we’ve all evolved in tribes of 150 people. When someone comes along, they may be your only option for a partner.</p><p>When you choose something, you get locked in for a long time. Starting a business may take ten years. You start a relationship that will be five years or maybe more. You move to a city for ten to twenty years. These are very, very long-lived decisions. It’s very, very important we only say yes when we are pretty certain. You’re never going to be absolutely certain, but you’re going to be very certain.</p><p>If you find yourself creating a spreadsheet for a decision with a list of yes’s and nos, pros and cons, checks and balances, why this is good or bad…forget it. If you cannot decide, the answer is no. - Naval </p><p><strong>The meaning of empathy.</strong></p><p>“The beauty of empathy is that it doesn’t demand that you agree with the other person’s ideas” - Chris Voss</p><h3>Question</h3><p>How much time are you spending thinking about change compared to doing something about it?</p><p>That’s all for this week.</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p><p>With love, Nick x</p><p>p.s. 100 days without drinking today.
