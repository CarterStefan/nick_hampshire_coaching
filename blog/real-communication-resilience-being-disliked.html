They count purely on instincts and signals to understand.</p><p>They don’t require words and they cannot be fooled. They read their fellow species and scenarios immaculately well.</p><p>Before spoken word we were no different.</p><p>Humans can forget these pures instincts and rely heavily on use of words to navigate life and relationships. </p><p>Paying very little attention to what is actually being said. 7%.</p><p>If we want to become better communicators and deepen our connections and relationships we have to focus on the 93%.</p><p>The meaning behind the words, the expressions shown and body language used.</p><p>For humans it’s extremely difficult to hide how we feel through our body language.</p><p>Yet we often aren’t looking for it. </p><p>Someone may tell us with words they are fine yet really they are in despair. </p><p>Certain emotions are very difficult to put into words and people often won’t tell us how they feel.</p><p>But they will always show us.</p><p>If we just paid closer attention.</p><p>Next time you’re in a conversation, look deeper.</p><p>Look for the reason, look for the meaning.</p><p>Look again.</p><p>People are giving us answers all the time. </p><p>Go beyond the words.</p><p></p><p><em>Working with me</em></p><p><em>I help people with their communication and public speaking through training, bespoke coaching alongside speaking - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nickhampshire_">reach out here</a> for a conversation to learn more.</em></p><h3>What I’m learning</h3><p><strong>How viewing challenges shapes performance.</strong></p><p>A study on trail runners found that mental toughness and resilience accounted for 21 percent of performance differences between runners. This study gave runners a questionnaire about how they viewed challenges - for example, it asked to what degree they viewed threats as opportunities and how they viewed difficulties - and compared the data to their running performance. Those with the highest resilience scores had faster times. </p><p><strong>The courage to be disliked.</strong></p><p>“It’s that you are disliked by someone. It is proof that you are exercising your freedom and living in freedom, and a sign that you are living in accordance with your own principles.” - Ichiro Kishimi</p><p><strong>You only live once.</strong></p><p>“You have two lives, and the second one begins when you realize you only have one” - Naval</p><h3>Question</h3><p>Where are you spending most of your attention? Is it giving you more or taking more from you?</p><h3>Life Hack</h3><p>Leave a book next to your bed and your phone away from it. You’ll fall asleep faster and sleep deeper. </p><p>That’s all for this week.</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p><p>With love, Nick x</p><p>p.s. when enough is enough</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/real-communication-resilience-and?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/real-communication-resilience-and/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="directMessage button"></div><p></p>
