    <h1>Finding Purpose, Thinking Ahead & Where To Pay Attention</h1>
    <p class="">July 24, 2025</p>
    <article class="mt-4">
      <p>Hello my friend,</p><p>Last week I ran our first Running Minds <em>signature </em>event.</p><p>A huge thank you to all of you who attended!</p><p>After creating the group in January it felt really special to be able to put this event on.</p><p>Seeing so many open minded and curious people come together to connect with others and to discover more about their own wellbeing was inspiring.</p><p>Since the turn of the year the weekly meetups we’ve had, moving together alongside open and honest conversation has made it all so worth it for me personally.</p><p>The event last wednesday offered another reminder of how meaningful real conversation and connection really is. </p><p>The power in which it holds and that is available to all of us. </p><p>People showed up with intention.</p><p>They shared with vulnerability. </p><p>This in turn created a space for others to feel more comfortable doing the same.</p><p>There is a real lesson in this.</p><p>During the event itself we covered a lot around health and wellbeing.</p><p>The mindset, habits and actions we can engage to better protect and strengthen our body and our mind.</p><p>The name of the event ‘A Purpose in Wellbeing’ was a particular point I went deeper into.</p><p>How we can find more meaning in our wellbeing. </p><p>Why putting our physical and mental health can be that purpose we’ve been seeking.</p><p>Putting our wellbeing first not a selfish act, it’s very much on the contrary.</p><p>On a plane when safety instructions are read out they always tell us to put our own seat belt and oxygen mask on first.</p><p>Before we do anything for anyone else.</p><p>I see it the same with our health and wellbeing.</p><p>We can only show up with what we have.</p><p>We can only give what we’ve got.</p><p>If we are running on an empty tank physically or mentally, or both, we cannot possibly be of value and service to the people around us. </p><p>By having more we get to give more.</p><p>The fact is that our health is the table that everything else sits on. </p><p>It’s the foundation for everything else in our lives.</p><p>Without it nothing else matters.</p><p>If the table isn’t strong we can’t place much weight on it. </p><p>If the table collapses everything else goes down with it.</p><p>Many of us have it around the other way.</p><p>We will find the time to move our bodies, go to the gym, spend quality time with friends, take a hike, start the meditation, begin the journal only once we have the resources and time around all those other things that are on the table.</p><p>This was the biggest turning point for me.</p><p>Recognising this some years back profoundly changed my life for the better.</p><p>I realised after many years that I was putting everything else I ‘needed’ to do first.</p><p>Living much of my life on autopilot.</p><p>Fulfilling constant demands of others.</p><p>Chasing hard the things I thought I ‘should’ be chasing.</p><p>That everyone else appeared to be doing.</p><p>This came at a heavy price.</p><p>My health and wellbeing suffered.</p><p>I wasn’t putting myself first.</p><p>Many sleep broken nights and days filled with stress, fatigue and worry.</p><p>I wasn’t giving my body or my mind the things it needed.</p><p>Strength, nutrients, calm, rest.</p><p>After much of my twenties in this state I realised it couldn’t be sustainable.</p><p>I had to make a change.</p><p>I realised that nothing in my life would be stable if my mind and body were unstable. </p><p>I recognised that it wasn’t just myself who would suffer but also those around me. </p><p>When I wasn’t good for me I was certainly no good for them.</p><p>When I was better for me, I was better for them.</p><p>This was the shift I needed.</p><p>Making my health and wellbeing my number one value and priority.</p><p>Giving it more meaning. Making it a purpose. </p><p>By doing better by ourselves we are doing better by everyone else.</p><p>A rising tide lifts all boats.</p><p>As Gandhi said, “If you want to change the world, start with you...</p><h3>Things I’m learning</h3><p><strong>Thinking ahead.</strong></p><p>"Focus on the seeds, not the trees. What seeds are you planting today?" - <em>James Clear</em></p><p><strong>Why we should walk and walk some more.</strong></p><p>Albert Einstein put it this way: I take time to go for long walks on the beach so that I can listen to what is going on inside my head. If my work isn’t going well, I lie down in the middle of a workday and gaze at the ceiling while I listen and visualise what goes on in my imagination. </p><p>Mozart felt the same way: When I am traveling in a carriage or walking after a good meal or during the night when I cannot sleep - it is on such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly. - <em>Morgan Housel</em></p><p><strong>Life is what we pay attention to.</strong></p><p>“Satisfaction comes not from chasing bigger and bigger things, but paying attention to smaller and smaller things.” - <em>Arthur Brooks</em></p><h3>Question</h3><p>Where could you invest more into your life? Your health, relationships, work, personal development? Which of these would most likely pay off the most in the long term?</p><p>That’s all for this week.</p><p>Thank you as ever for reading.</p><p>With love, Nick. x</p><p>P.S To keep up to date with all things Running Minds <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/running-minds/">follow here :)</a></p><p>P.P.S. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ugky8wxQ7aXmhqaW7">My new Public Speaking workshop is live!
