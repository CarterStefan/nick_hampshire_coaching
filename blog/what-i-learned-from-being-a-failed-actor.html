    <h1>What I Learned from Being a Failed Actor</h1>
    <p class="">November 21, 2025</p>
    <article class="mt-4">
      <p>“Hi Nick, we are very pleased to offer you the lead in the show. The audition was great and we are delighted to offer you this part”</p><p>A voicemail left on my parents’ house phone. </p><p>I was 15 years old.</p><p>I never returned the call. </p><p>I felt crippled with fear.</p><p>Imposter syndrome was dominating me.</p><p>Although I couldn’t name what it was at the time.</p><p>I had nailed an audition with a large UK youth theatre group the week previously.</p><p>With shows lined up across most major cities in some of the biggest venues it was a hell of an opportunity.</p><p>Yet the whole time I was hoping I wouldn’t be offered it.</p><p>Because I didn’t want to find myself in a position which I was in right now.</p><p>To have to make a decision I didn’t want to make.</p><p>With the regret and feeling of shame that would likely follow.</p><p>Yet the funny thing was I would always audition and give my all when the pressure was off. </p><p>I always wanted to show my best and make a great impression. Yet somewhere deep down it I felt I would fuck up somewhere down the road.</p><p>Interesting behaviour which I’ve spent much time thinking over since.</p><p>I felt I would be found out and seen as a failure.</p><p>I was scared to fail yet I was failing to take the chance to fail in the first place.</p><p>I was trapped in a mindset that was so worried of not being good enough.</p><p>So scared of failure. I stayed still.</p><p>The irony was that this made me feel like the very thing I was trying to avoid.</p><p>I remember that phone call like yesterday.</p><p>In some ways it has haunted me ever since.</p><p>It could have been an incredible opportunity that would have lifted off an acting career.</p><p>I have struggled to forgive myself sometimes.</p><p>It hurts seeing myself in hindsight.</p><p>So much ability yet often so little faith in myself.</p><p>I have worked hard on that for two decades since and I found a way out.</p><p>I don’t feel that way any more.</p><p>Am I still scared of being found out?</p><p>Do I still have imposter syndrome?</p><p>Yes, but far less.</p><p>Actually I’ve learned that these are signs of stretching ourselves and signals of growth.</p><p>With that in mind, it doesn’t stop me when it’s there.</p><p>I don’t let it get in my way like I once did.</p><p>As I sit here writing this I am a successful failed actor, with the what could have been narrative once again raising its ugly head.</p><p>Of course, it’s not too late. </p><p>I could act again.</p><p>Maybe I will someday. </p><p>I still love acting. </p><p>I love what it gave me.</p><p>I love what I could give of myself to it.</p><p>I don’t still regret not “making it” as an actor but I do regret not believing enough in myself.</p><p>I had some weird pressure on me to be the next “thing” in the local area. </p><p>It was a small area.</p><p>Although still, a town on the edge of south west London, a decent pool. </p><p>I was told by many directors <em>I had to</em> pursue becoming a professional actor. </p><p>Like I owed it to myself or I owed it to them.</p><p>Maybe in some way that pressure is something that held me down rather than raised me up.</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>It wasn’t just about that phone call.</p><p>It was about years of not taking chances.</p><p>Not having enough courage or faith in myself.</p><p>I have learned a fair bit since then.</p><p>Firstly, people don’t think about us nearly as much as we think. </p><p>It’s not like we build up in our heads. Or at least like I did in mine.</p><p>When we realise this it is liberating.</p><p>Secondly, we cannot learn or grow a jot without being comfortable with failure. </p><p>It’s non-negotiable if we want to better ourselves or be successful in anything.</p><p>It’s actually where all the magic happens. </p><p>Those lessons from my younger days have proven invaluable.</p><p>I used them and continue to do so to my advantage. </p><p>I am not nearly as scared of failing, taking risks or looking silly like I once was.</p><p>But I still see many people living that way now.</p><p>People I know. People I love.</p><p>Some can’t or won’t escape it.</p><p>Some felt just like I did not that many years back.</p><p>But I now know something with absolute certainty.</p><p>We will be more disappointed by the things we didn’t do than by the ones we did.</p><p>At the end of our lives we will only regret those chances we didn’t take.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p><p>Nick x</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/what-i-learned-from-being-a-failed?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/what-i-learned-from-being-a-failed/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="directMessage button"></div><p></p><p></p><p></p>
