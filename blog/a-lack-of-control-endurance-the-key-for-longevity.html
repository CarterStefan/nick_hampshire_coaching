More than 190,000 dementia-free men and women (average age 56) were involved in the study and followed for at least 10 years.</p><p>Participants underwent brain imaging and took tests that measured handgrip strength, problem-solving skills, memory, and reasoning abilities. People with lower grip scores were more likely to have problems with thinking and memory- and an increased risk of dementia - later in life than those who'd had higher handgrip strength scores at the start of the study.</p><p><strong>How to grow.</strong></p><p>“Stress + rest = growth. This equation holds true regardless of what it is that you are trying to grow.” - Brad Stulberg</p><p><strong>Stamina for life.</strong></p><p>“Endurance is the struggle to continue against a mounting desire to stop.” - Alex Hutchinson</p><h3>Question</h3><p>What is one question you wish you had asked someone but didn’t? Who else could you ask it to?</p><p>That’s all for this week. </p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read.</p><p>With Love, Nick x</p><p>P.S: Running Minds will still be going as I step away for a few weeks. If you are in Madrid and you want to come along for a run, a walk or a coffee conversation drop me an email. More exciting meets and events to come this summer!</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/a-lack-of-control-endurance-and-the?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://nickhampshire.substack.com/p/a-lack-of-control-endurance-and-the/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="directMessage button"></div><p></p>
