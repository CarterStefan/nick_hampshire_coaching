That was everything I had.<br/><br/>The rest was all left behind.</p><p>I was about to embark on a new journey in a new country.<br/><br/>Some hours later I arrived to the capital of Spain, Madrid. <br/><br/>I jumped in a taxi, picked up my keys and headed to my apartment.<br/><br/>With COVID still spreading like wildfire I was delighted to find I’d been given the basement room.<br/><br/>A tiny box room, no windows, no bedding.</p><p>Just my suitcase, me and a google translator app.</p><p>A country that just announced that very morning that a second lockdown would start the following day and that it was strongly advisable not to go out or socialise. </p><p>Perfect when arriving not knowing anyone.<br/><br/>It was in that moment on arriving to my room, the 1st of October 2020, when I thought to myself...<br/><br/>What the F have I done?! <br/><br/>No job, no Spanish, no friends and a room that looks like a prison.<br/><br/>I’d left my whole life (a half decent one in theory) behind.<br/><br/>As I look back now I had no real idea what I was doing.<br/><br/>But I do remember that I had a strong intuition and urge for change and to try something new.<br/><br/>That I was too comfortable.<br/><br/>As someone who used to sit comfortably in my comfort zone I was getting tired of it, tired of me.<br/><br/>Fear of failure, fear of looking stupid, fear of new challenge and change.<br/><br/>They were so prevalent in my life for many years.<br/><br/>Now I realise they were all just made up in my head.<br/><br/>They quickly go away once we lead with a little more action, take a few more risks and start challenging ourselves.</p><p>Writing here has further helped me see that clearly. It has taught me so much.<br/><br/>As I reflect now five years on I don’t know what made me make the move.<br/><br/>But I just knew I couldn’t stay still.</p><p>There were no lessons, growth or rewards in doing that.<br/><br/>Some feeling was rumbling deep down that I had to make a significant change.<br/><br/>To just jump and try something new and unknown.<br/><br/>The first three or so months in Madrid were especially tough.<br/><br/>Living with eight people and blabbing my way through my almost non existent Spanish.</p><p>Oh, and a global pandemic.<br/><br/>I was certainly being challenged.<br/><br/>But with time I started to figure it all out.</p><p>One step and one challenge at a time.<br/><br/>Things started to align.<br/><br/>I made some friends, found a job teaching, went to new groups.<br/><br/>Started understanding and speaking the local language.</p><p>Started feeling right at home.<br/><br/>As I sit here five years on I’m so glad I stuck out those early uncertain months.<br/><br/>If life feels bland or uncertain if may be because there’s something bigger waiting around the corner.<br/><br/>Throwing ourselves into something new, challenging and uncertain might just be the perfect answer.</p><p>At least it was for me.<br/><br/>Don’t stay still.</p><p>Don’t allow fear to get in the way.</p><p>I remind myself of this every day.<br/><br/>Thank you to everyone who I’ve met in this special city for being part of the camino. </p><p>Here’s to the next five years!</p><p>Nick. x</p><h3>Things I’m learning</h3><p><strong>Mood over matter.</strong></p><p>“Make your mood, or it makes you.” - <em>Shane Parish</em></p><p><strong>New habits.</strong></p><p>“The beginning of a habit is like an invisible thread, but every time we repeat the act, we strengthen the strand, add to it another filament, until it binds us irrevocably in thought and act.” - <em>Dr. Orison Swett Marden</em></p><p><strong>Fixing mistakes quickly.</strong></p><p>“You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged by it.” - <em>Paulo Coelho</em></p><h3>Question</h3><p>The world is completely uncertain anyway, so why are you so concerned about making a change?</p><p>Thank you for reading!</p><p>With Love.
